 * FCH::MISC doesn't even pretend not to be a garbage barge.  There is also
 * MISC2, which is a separate discontiguous functional unit described by a
 * different header.  Additionally, we exclude the I2C pad control registers
 * from this functional unit because they are properly part of either the IOMUX
 * or the GPIO subsystem, and the drivers that want those shouldn't have access
 * to the rest of the contents of this block.  As a result, we have split this
 * into three virtual functional units: MISC_A, I2CPAD, and MISC_B.

/*
 * FCH::MISC::I2Cn_PADCTRL.  Sets electrical parameters of pads that may be (but
 * are not always, depending on the IOMUX) associated with I2C functions.  These
 * pads are designed for I2C and have somewhat limited functionality as a
 * result; most significantly, they have open-drain drivers and selectable
 * voltages.
 *
 * All the I2C pad control registers are identical in a given FCH, but are quite
 * different between Huashan and Songshan, where the latter supports I3C on the
 * same pads.  The PPRs do give these as distinct registers rather than
 * instances of the same register, but we feel that's overly tedious and treat
 * them as 6 instances of the same one.
 *
 * Many of the Songshan fields have 2 bits with the same meaning, one for "pad
 * 0" and the other for "pad 1"; one bit controls the pad associated with the
 * clock signal and one with the data signal.  We aren't told which is which.
 * XXX Get the logic analyser and figure it out; for now we assume clock is 0.
