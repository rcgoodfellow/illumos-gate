/*
 * These are utility routines, mostly for metaprogramming, used to provide
 * access to functional units in the AMD Fusion Controller Hub (FCH).  While
 * most FCHs are fairly similar, the emphasis is on support for the EPYC-branded
 * server processor families, which contain the following FCH models (all FCHs
 * appear to be named for mountains):
 *
 * Processor Family		FCH Model
 * --------------------------------------
 *  Naples			Taishan
 *  Rome, Milan			Huashan
 *  Genoa, Bergamo		Songshan
 *
 * Support for additional models, as well as additional functional units and
 * registers for these models, can and should be added as the need arises.
 *
 * Most of the functional units in these FCHs can be accessed via SMN or MMIO,
 * and the region normally located between 0xfed8_0000 and 0xfed8_2000 can be
 * accessed on secondary FCHs via MMIO at a semi-arbitrary location specified by
 * a BAR.  We choose functional units so that all registers in each have the
 * same offset relative to an SMN base and an MMIO base, allowing us to reuse
 * the definitions to get a register instance representing either access method
 * as we choose.  This is easier than it might seem; as an example the Huashan
 * register space looks like this:

 * (*) The SPI and eSPI regions are set by a nonstandard BAR in the LPC
 * controller's PCI config space; eSPI is always SPI + 0x1_0000.  At reset, this
 * BAR holds 0xFEC1_0000.  We don't know whether the SPI controller also appears
 * at 0xFEDD_4000 as we would expect it to, or if it has a second set of
 * registers that appear there.
 *
 * (+) Documentation suggests that the FCH can be configured to decode a region
 * of memory at 0xFEB0_0000 for the watchdog timer, but doing so doesn't seem to
 * have any effect, and this region is normally used for PCI or other
 * general-purpose MMIO assignments.  The region at 0xFED8_0B00 is used instead;
 * it's possible that this alternate space was intended to allow accessing the
 * WDT on a page by itself.  The HPET region is similar, but the page-by-itself
 * decoding option definitely works and is the standard means of accessing the
 * HPET.
 *
 * (?) These regions are listed in documentation but their internal organisation
 * is not described.  So-called BIOS RAM and CMOS RAM are legacy PC concepts
 * that are most likely emulated in their respective regions; we do not use them
 * and they do not contain registers.  The function of DP-VGA is completely
 * unknown.
 *
 * (A) There are two different ways to think about this range, depending on the
 * origin of the access.  From the Zen core, this region is conventionally
 * decoded by the xAPIC when in xAPIC mode, though this can be changed by
 * setting Core::X86::Msr::APIC_BAR.  Because the local APIC is part of the
 * logical processor itself, the access never reaches the FCH when the core is
 * in xAPIC mode; this is discussed in the Milan B1 PPR section dealing with how
 * core memory accesses are decoded.  It's possible that these do reach the FCH
 * from a core when in x2APIC mode, but as nothing in the FCH decodes them there
 * is nothing to access.  From a northbridge (e.g., on behalf of MSIs sent
 * upstream by PCIe devices), there is no programmable BAR.  All MSI delivery is
 * done to this fixed address region that is decoded for local APICs (regardless
 * of whether in xAPIC or x2APIC mode) by the PIE; indeed, there is language
 * suggesting that the translation into HT interrupts to be decoded by the PIE
 * occurs in the NB itself, and these never hit the DF as normal memory accesses
 * at all.  Regardless, these accesses are not decoded by the FCH's IOMS via any
 * of the DF range registers.  So despite hitting in the FCH's range, these APIC
 * addresses do not refer to any FCH functionality and the FCH never decodes
 * them regardless of their origin.
