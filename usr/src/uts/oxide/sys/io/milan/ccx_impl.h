/*
 * Maximum Zen cores/thread parameters for Milan.  Naples and Rome each have
 * up to 4 cores per CCX and 2 CCXs per CCD; Naples always has 1 CCD per
 * IO die as they were colocated.  Supporting Rome or other old processor
 * packages requires generalising these parameters.  CCX == L3.
 *
 * Namespaces
 *
 * Each CCD, CCX, and core shares two distinct integer namespaces with its
 * siblings: a compact logical one and a possibly sparse physical one.  These
 * names are unique among siblings but not across e.g. cousins.  Both names are
 * provided to us for each object by the DF and APOB, and which name is used
 * to compute a register or bit address varies from one register to the next.
 * Therefore we need, and keep, both of them.  The logical name should always
 * correspond to the index into the parent's array.
 *
 * Threads are different: each core has some number of threads which in current
 * implementations is either 1 or 2.  There is no separate physical thread
 * identifier as there is no way for some discontiguous subset of threads to
 * exist.  Therefore each thread has but a single logical identifier, also its
 * index within its parent core's array of them.  However, the thread also has
 * an APIC ID, which unlike the other identifiers is globally unique across the
 * entire fabric.  The APIC ID namespace is sparse when any of a thread's
 * containing entities is one of a collection of siblings whose number is not
 * a power of 2.
 *
 * One last note on APIC IDs: while we compute the APIC ID that is assigned to
 * each thread by firmware prior to boot, that ID can be changed by writing to
 * the thread's APIC ID MSR (or, in xAPIC mode which we never use, the
 * analogous MMIO register).  The one we compute and store here is the one
 * set by firmware before boot.
