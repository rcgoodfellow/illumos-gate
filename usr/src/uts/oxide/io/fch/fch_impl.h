 * XXX There is a ddi_intrspec_t in the DDI, but it's supposed to be obsolete;
 * there is a struct intrspec that implements that opaque type in PCI but it's
 * not useful either.  Here's something that would be useful if only we had some
 * way to pass it to apix.
 *
 * The fi_src is a source index in the FCH's ixbar downstream of the IOAPIC.
 * The polarity and trigger mode describe how the IOAPIC pin chosen to receive
 * the interrupts should be configured.  These enumerated types from sys/apix.h
 * describe hardware in the sense that they correspond to configuration that can
 * be set up in the IOAPIC, but the in-memory representation here is not
 * intended to, and need not, match that in any APIC registers.
 *
 * For now, we support only one interrupt source per child node, but there is no
 * reason this couldn't be expanded if needed in future since it looks exactly
 * like the register specs.  While the actual source identifiers are only 7 bits
 * wide, we allow an abstract 32-bit source ID should we need to accommodate
 * other types of interrupt source.
