 * potentially (with future expansion) in some client processors and chipsets.
 *
 * ==================
 * FCH Identification
 * ==================
 *
 * There is no known internal means of discovering what kind of FCH is present
 * even if we know the range of addresses it decodes.  Some evidence indicates
 * there's an undocumented e-fuse we could read that contains an identifier, but
 * none of the PPRs mention it and it always reads zero.  So we have to assume
 * the type based on our processor family as reported by the cpuid chiprev
 * mechanism.  While some peripherals (see note below) do have registers we
 * could read to determine their revision, the set of peripheral revisions
 * available to us does not uniquely identify an FCH as several different FCHs
 * incorporate peripherals with the same revisions.  While it will not be
 * terribly difficult to add support for any of several additional FCH models
 * that exist, at present we support only these:
 *
 * FCH		Processor Family
 * -----------------------------
 * Huashan	Rome, Milan
 * Songshan	Genoa
 *
 * The Taishan FCH incorporated into Naples processors poses challenges that
 * others do not, on account of its internal multi-die organisation, though most
 * of these challenges pertain to our children.
 *
 * Note that (nearly) all FCHs are named for mountains, including the well-known
 * Promontory client parts and the misfits, Shang and Shasta.  If the ambiguous
 * name Hengshan has been used for an FCH, we don't know of it.
 *
 * ==================
 * Child Nomenclature
 * ==================
 *
 * Several of the FCH's peripherals are really behind a poorly-documented
 * AXI-to-AHB-to-APB bridge, part of what AMD calls the A-Link/B-Link bridge.
 * Ideally we might be able to give them names like we do with PCI; e.g.,
 * apbXXXX,YYYY.  This would allow us to use aliases and in theory to support
 * these fairly common devices even if on some future platform they're found on
 * some other nexus such as a native APB or AHB nexus.  Unfortunately, while
 * Synopsys/DesignWare seem to have adopted at least a semi-consistent practice
 * of putting a pair of registers at the end of each device's 256-byte region
 * that identify the peripheral and its version, nothing in the AMBA
 * specifications even remotely suggests that discovery and enumeration are part
 * of the standard or that peripherals are expected to provide any means (never
 * mind a specific means) of doing this.  Indeed, the concept of a peripheral
 * having registers at all isn't discussed.  So in the service of hardware we do
 * have, we'll do the simple thing and name nodes after our own drivers.  Maybe
 * someday this can be better.  Individual leaf drivers can and should make use
 * of the identifying information available, if any.
 *
 * Each child has a static definition, and each FCH model has a static
 * definition containing a collection of children.  This approach is not
 * terribly different from the concept of passing the kernel a static DeviceTree
 * at boot and having the kernel then set up pinmuxing and other configuration
 * to realise it; however, we're aiming for something more flexible that allows
 * for use of multiple conflicting peripherals and runtime configuration.
 * Additionally, this is only a small part of the overall system device
 * hierarchy and for the most part there is no reason to expose any of this
 * information outside this implementation.
 *
 * Each child device node has, in the DDI, an instance and a unit address.  The
 * instance number is associated with the driver itself and is entirely under
 * the DDI's control.  Historically the unit address has often been a (resource
 * type, address offset) pair, but it is under the parent nexus's control.  We
 * want to guarantee that each specific peripheral that is a child of this
 * driver always has the same /devices path, primarily because certain boot code
 * (e.g., the console setup) relies on it.  There are two places we consider the
 * unit address: one is for our own device node, for which the unit address is
 * under the *direct* control of rootnex but which we can influence; the other
 * is for our children.  Our own unit address is effectively set in
 * fch_ioms_cb() by relying on a Private rootnex behaviour; see the comment
 * there for details.  When we name our children, we always do so such that each
 * child of a given kind (node name) has as its unit address its index into the
 * array of children of the same kind below the same FCH nexus.  Thus if an FCH
 * has 3 UARTs, those UARTs will be "0", "1", and "2"; if the same FCH also has
 * three I2C controllers, they will likewise be "0", "1", and "2".  If the same
 * machine has a second FCH with the same peripherals, they will have the same
 * unit addresses ("0", "1", and "2" for each type).  There is no guarantee that
 * the instance number associated with a driver instance will match the unit
 * address of the leaf to which it is attached, for many reasons, and these must
 * not be conflated even on single-FCH machines.
 *
 * ===================
 * Resource Addressing
 * ===================
 *
 * In multi-socket (and older multi-die) systems there may be multiple FCHs in
 * the data fabric (DF).  The first FCH, attached to the DF via one of the IOMSs
 * (IOMS 3 in Milan, potentially a different one in other implementations), is
 * accessible via the subtractive address space at [0xfec0_0000, 0xffff_ffff]
 * (note that it can optionally decode a small region at 0xfeb0_0000 also).  The
 * entire set of peripherals in secondary FCHs is not available to us, nor can
 * peripherals in secondary FCHs generate interrupts.  However, it is possible
 * to access a single 8 KiB region of each secondary FCH if
 * FCH::PM::ALTMMIO{BASE,EN} have been set up.  This region corresponds to the
 * peripherals at [0xfed80_0000, 0xfed8_1fff] on the primary FCH.  This region
 * actually contains many disparate peripherals sharing just 2 pages of
 * registers.
 *
 * In principle, this nexus should be a child of the IOMS to which it's
 * attached, and that IOMS's driver should have created appropriate "ranges" and
 * other properties prior to our attaching to identify the resources available
 * to us and our children.  Because that doesn't exist, we use the same
 * hackaround used by pci_autoconfig to generate PCI bus nexi and by isa to
 * generate its own node: the fch_enumerate() routine does what the parent we
 * don't have should have done for us.  Although that parent doesn't currently
 * exist, we still rely on other software reserving the resources we need and
 * providing them to us, currently via milan_gen_resource_subsume() which is
 * also analogous to the PCI PRD mechanism but without the intermediate
 * abstraction that would be required to make this driver machine-independent.
 * That software must also ensure that access to those MMIO and legacy IO
 * regions is routed over the DF to the correct IOMS.
 *
 * Each child regspec definition is relative to the FCH's base address or to the
 * base address the FCH would have if it were the primary FCH.  This allows us
 * to use the same address offsets for children of both primary and secondary
 * FCHs and therefore to use the same child definitions.  The simplest way to
 * think about this is that the base address is the address of the register
 * block given by the PPR less 0xfec0_0000 (at least for all the FCHs we
 * currently know about).  These are adjusted to absolute physical addresses
 * during the child initialisation process, so that the "reg" properties in the
 * device tree end up looking very much like they do for PCI devices, without
 * the bus number and attributes found in the first 32 bits.  Most FCH
 * peripherals' registers can be accessed via either SMN or MMIO, but
 * unfortunately there is not a single straightforward way to translate the MMIO
 * address of a peripheral to the SMN address or vice versa.  See the address
 * space map and notes in sys/amdzen/fch.h for some more background.  In the
 * future we may wish to provide children access to their registers via SMN
 * access handles instead of MMIO, especially if access to secondary FCH
 * peripherals not included in the tiny alternate MMIO BAR is desired.  Children
 * would not be aware of this, just as they are unaware in principle of the
 * distinction between legacy IO space and MMIO space today.
 *
 * ==========
 * Interrupts
 * ==========
 *
 * Most but not all peripherals we support can generate interrupts.  In order to
 * understand how they are implemented here, a great deal of background is
 * needed.  A few bits of this background can be found in os/intr.c, but the
 * focus there is primarily on what happens once a CPU is interrupted.  This can
 * be read as a companion to that; it really belongs somewhere else, along with
 * most of the interrupt functionality in this driver, as will be discussed.
 * Our focus here is on what needs to happen in order for a CPU to be
 * interrupted when one of our children signals an interrupt.  In the distant
 * past, and on some hardware architectures even still today, this was very
 * simple.  For us it is anything but.  If there were theory statements in
 * io/apix/apix.c or os/ddi_impl.c, or any documentation whatsoever describing
 * their operation, you'd be reading those instead, but there aren't so get
 * comfortable.
 *
 * First, a bit of terminology.
 *
 * There are three different terms used in discussing interrupts that in the
 * past were used more or less interchangeably.  Much code still exists that
 * refers to one of these concepts using a different (and conflicting) name.
 *
 * vector/vec: This is an amd64 architectural concept.  Each CPU (logical
 * processor, which is to say a thread if SMT is enabled or a core if it is not)
 * has 256 interrupt vectors, of which the first 32 are reserved for exceptions.
 * Vectors are associated with *delivery* of interrupts to one or more CPUs.
 * Any number of different interrupt sources may be delivered to the same CPU on
 * the same vector.  There is much code that uses this term to refer to an IRQ,
 * even though IRQ->(apicid, vector) mapping was made indirect with the
 * introduction of the 82489DX in 1992.  The possible set of (apicid, vector)
 * destinations for any given interrupt source depends on the configuration of
 * the APICs, which can be and often is changed dynamically based on the state
 * of CPUs and interrupt balancing policies.  See the big theory statement in
 * os/intr.c for more details about how all this works, as well as the AMD64
 * architecture manual vol. 2 chapters 8 and 16.
 *
 * IRQ: An IRQ is an OS concept, an implementation detail of the IOAPIC and the
 * PSM code responsible for managing interrupts (apix, on oxide; possibly
 * pcplusmp or uppc on i86pc).  illumos uses IRQ alternately to refer to a
 * global index into the set of IOAPIC virtual wire inputs or to a specific
 * virtual wire input to a specific IOAPIC.  On i86pc, the PIC is also still
 * supported, and each PIC input is similarly assigned an IRQ number.  On modern
 * amd64 implementations, any fixed interrupt source can be mapped onto any
 * virtual wire input on at least one IOAPIC, and every virtual wire input on
 * every IOAPIC can be mapped to any destination APIC and vector.  The IRQ
 * number itself is therefore no longer meaningful except as a convenience for
 * identifying the intermediate hardware mechanism by which an interrupt
 * *source* is mapped to an interrupt *destination*.  IRQs may be shared among
 * multiple source devices, in which case (confusingly), apix creates an
 * additional IRQ number and data structure associated with each; the first is
 * the "real" IRQ and corresponds to a global index into an array of IOAPIC
 * pins, which the others are beyond the end of of that array.
 *
 * interrupt number/inum: With the introduction of the "new" DDI interrupt
 * routines introduced to support MSI-X (see PSARC 2004/253), this refers simply
 * to an index into an array of possible interrupts a device can generate.  Each
 * one represents a particular source, which may be an MSI interrupt, an MSI-X
 * interrupt, or a fixed interrupt which for PCI/PCIe may be INTA, INTB, etc.
 * For non-PCI devices, the set of possible interrupt sources depends on the
 * device itself, the machine and processor implementation, and the illumos
 * machine architecture.  On PCs, fixed interrupt sources are for the most part
 * permanently bound by firmware to a specific virtual wire input to a specific
 * IOAPIC (together, an IRQ number); on the oxide architecture, we are free to
 * associate each source with any mechanism the hardware permits.  As the
 * interrupt number is merely an index, the underlying meaning of the interrupt
 * source has to come from somewhere.  On i86pc, it's an IRQ number that comes
 * from ACPI tables associated with the source device; on oxide, it's ideally a
 * hardware source identifier that can be mapped onto an IOAPIC pin by the
 * interrupt crossbar (ixbar).
 *
 * These terms are confusing not only because of inconsistent usage but also
 * because the concepts to which they refer are often used inconsistently by
 * different pieces of code depending on age and origin.  There are a few other
 * less confusing terms we'll encounter:
 *
 * ipl/spl/priority: This is an integer that describes a policy associated with
 * delivery of an interrupt.  The BTS in os/intr.c discusses this in some
 * detail; importantly, the association between ipl and vector is fixed on i86pc
 * when using the uppc/pcplusmp PSMs (for legacy PIC/xAPIC) but this constraint
 * is relaxed when x2APIC hardware is available and thus apix can be used
 * instead.  The oxide architecture requires x2APIC hardware, supports only
 * apix, and always operates in x2APIC mode.  It is possible for a device driver
 * or an operator to request that each of its interrupt sources be delivered at
 * a particular priority via the interrupt-priorities IEEE1275 ("OBP") property,
 * discussed below.  This driver's support for this is incomplete, however.
 *
 * We can now get more concrete about what these terms mean by considering the
 * hardware itself.
 *
 * On very old (pre-8086) and very simple (some microcontrollers today)
 * hardware, the physical microprocessor has some number of physical input pins
 * that allow external devices to generate interrupts.  Usually each pin
 * corresponds to a specific interrupt or vector number; the device asserts the
 * interrupt, the processor saves state and hands control to the software at the
 * location corresponding to that vector.  There is a tremendous amount of
 * confusion in terminology in this area: the identity of the interrupt may be
 * called a vector or an IRQ or an interrupt number or an interrupt line or an
 * interrupt pin or very probably several other names, but the essence of it is
 * that there is an integer that describes both the source of the interrupt and
 * the manner in which it is delivered: the source implies a CPU-visible vector
 * number and, on some architectures, a priority level:
 *
 * +--------------+         INTR 0 +-----------+	Interrupt Vector Table
 * | Peripheral A |--------------->| Processor |-+        +----------------+
 * +--------------+       +------->|  (core)   | | Trap N | Handler N Addr |
 *                        | INTR 1 +-----------+ |        +----------------+
 * +--------------+       |                      |        |       ~~~      |
 * | Peripheral B |-------+                      |        +----------------+
 * +--------------+                              | Trap 1 | Handler B Addr |
 *                                               |        +----------------+
 *                                               | Trap 0 | Handler A Addr |
 *                                               +------->+----------------+
 *
 * What has occurred since then consists of the addition of numerous layers of
 * abstraction as well as mechanical changes needed to accommodate large numbers
 * of devices in switched fabrics as well as multiple processors.  We will skip
 * ahead (ignoring the legacy 8259/A interrupt controller discussed in
 * os/intr.c) to the current world, which retains the IVT, called the IDT on
 * x86, but replaces nearly everything else between it and the peripherals
 * themselves.  Additionally, on many hardware architectures, including ours,
 * many of these peripherals are contained in the same package as the processor
 * core(s).  The FCH and the peripherals it contains used to be (and on Intel
 * platforms, still are) called a southbridge; before that, the peripherals were
 * separate from the southbridge itself, which contained only the glue logic for
 * routing transactions and performing bus arbitration.  Even farther in the
 * past, the southbridge itself would have comprised multiple independent
 * packages, which along with the northbridge were called a chipset once vendors
 * started offering integrated collections of parts to perform these functions
 * together.  Regardless of how these things are packaged, on all AMD platforms
 * since the beginning of the 21st century, this functionality looks more or
 * less the same and supports several new concepts.
 *
 * PCIe INTx Emulation
 *
 * In the PCI Local Bus 3.0 (and older) spec, each PCI function could optionally
 * generate an interrupt on one of 4 physical pins, lettered A through D; each
 * function's configuration space *Interrupt Pin* register indicates which of
 * these pins, if any, that function uses.  A complex and probably needlessly
 * confusing swizzling mechanism was defined so that as each end device's
 * interrupt wires were routed through a series of bridges, they would be mapped
 * onto (really, physically connected to) a different interrupt wire on the next
 * upstream bus segment.  This was intended to limit forced sharing of
 * PIC/IOAPIC pins ("IRQs", sometimes), because each interrupt wire on the bus
 * ended up at a particular PIC or IOAPIC pin.  These interrupts, then, were
 * essentially a shared bus not dissimilar to I2C: to assert an interrupt, a
 * device would pull one of its interrupt pins low; no matter which device
 * asserted the interrupt, the CPU would end up at the same vector.  This is
 * also why legacy PCI interrupts are always level-triggered and active-low.
 * Prior to booting, firmware, using board-specific knowledge, would figure out
 * where each interrupt pin used by any PCI function ended up (i.e., which input
 * to a PIC or IOAPIC) and put the resulting PIC or IOAPIC pin number (later,
 * index into an ACPI table) into the *Interrupt Line* config space register for
 * the OS to use as an IRQ number.  The PCI Local Bus 3.0 spec discusses much of
 * this in sections 2.2.6 and 6.2.4.
 *
 * With the introduction of message-based serial interconnects (MSI in PCI 3.0
 * and then MSI and MSI-X in PCIe), the individual interrupt wires were replaced
 * by message-signalled interrupts.  To support legacy hardware (e.g., ASICs
 * with PCI cores behind a PCIe-PCI bridge) and legacy OSs, an emulation
 * mechanism was introduced for the purpose of allowing downstream devices
 * generate interrupts that would look like legacy wired interrupts.  It is also
 * possible for native PCIe devices to be configured to generate these fixed
 * interrupts, but as they are strictly inferior to native MSI in every way, all
 * illumos drivers have been updated to support the native mechanisms.  Upon
 * arrival at the root complex, the legacy INTx emulation messages are mapped
 * onto a set of internal interrupt sources, one for each of the 4 (or 8; it now
 * appears possible for each of 8 functions to use an interrupt, at least on
 * some systems; the additions are INTE through INTH) emulated interrupt wires.
 * All such messages, subject again to swizzling between their source and the
 * root complex, that arrive at the root complex with a specific emulated wire
 * name share a single interrupt source when they arrive at the ixbar just as
 * they would have in a typical legacy PCI architecture.  Each source may be
 * mapped onto IOAPIC virtual wire inputs in a hardware-specific manner; as with
 * PCI INTx wires, on PCs these mappings are constructed by firmware prior to
 * boot and are considered fixed; they are communicated to the OS via ACPI or,
 * on machines with *very* old firmware, an Intel MP BIOS data structure.
 *
 * On machines implementing the oxide archtecture, PCIe INTx emulation messages
 * are not supported.  Device drivers supporting PCI/PCI-X/PCIe leaf and nexus
 * devices must provide support for MSI and/or MSI-X interrupts.  All PCIe
 * devices and all but the oldest PCI end devices and bridges support at least
 * MSI interrupts.  Therefore, all fixed interrupt sources on oxide machines are
 * associated with non-PCI devices.
 *
 * Remapping
 *
 * In addition to all of the above, an IOMMU can be used to perform interrupt
 * remapping.  The IOMMU (sometimes IMMU on Intel machines) is part of the
 * northbridge or its conceptual replacement, meaning that interrupts are
 * remapped according to a table programmed into the IOMMU immediately prior to
 * being placed onto the internal APIC bus.  This remapping therefore takes
 * place closer to the CPUs than any IOAPIC, PCIe RC, or other bridging device
 * downstream of the local APIC itself.  The effect of this remapping is that
 * the (apicid, vector) target associated with the interrupt message is
 * virtualised as an index into a per-source-device table.  For PCI sources,
 * the B/D/F is used to select the table; non-PCI sources are identified in a
 * hardware-specific manner.  Each table maps the (apicid, vector) pair onto a
 * new (apicid, vector) pair to which the interrupt should be sent; critically,
 * as all normal APIC messages allow only 8 bits for the APIC ID, the IOMMU
 * supports a 128-bit interrupt routing table entry format in x2APIC mode that
 * allows use of 32-bit destination APIC IDs.  This is necessary to support
 * delivering interrupts to more than 255 logical processors.  Section 2.2.5 of
 * the AMD IOMMU specification provides additional detail.
 *
 * Putting It Together
 *
 * If the above prose isn't doing it for you, consider this block diagram
 * showing the progress of an interrupt from its origin to its delivery as a
 * vectored interrupt at a logical processor (illumos: CPU).  This doesn't cover
 * special interrupt types like NMIs and SMIs, nor does it cover exceptions
 * taken locally on a CPU or generated as IPIs via the local APIC, but it covers
 * all the common cases we're interested in here: interrupts generated by
 * devices downstream of the processor's north- and southbridges, which includes
 * both external devices like PCIe end devices and internal peripherals like
 * SATA and USB controllers, UARTs, and LPC/ISA bridges.  This is a general,
 * conceptual diagram; not every system has all the types of devices shows, most
 * "buses" are really crossbar-switched message-passing networks, and so on.
 * PCIe bridges and root complexes are not shown for end devices using MSI or
 * MSI-X interrupts; numerous other details are also not shown.  Consult the PCI
 * Local Bus specification and AMD PPRs governing NBIO, DF, and FCH
 * functionality.  Non-oxide/non-AMD machines are somewhat different.

 *
 * The critical elements to understand here are the potential for three levels
 * of indirection between an interrupt source (here, FCH peripherals and
 * PCI/PCIe end devices) and the logical processor(s) to which the interrupt is
 * to be delivered:
 *
 * 1. The ixbar controlled by the poorly-named PCI_INTR_INDEX and PCI_INTR_DATA
 *    registers maps fixed hardware-specific source identifiers onto an IOAPIC
 *    virtual wire number.  There is one such crossbar in each AMD FCH; the
 *    destination is always the IOAPIC in the same FCH.
 *
 * 2. The IOAPIC itself; most AMD processors have additional IOAPICs in the
 *    northbridge which are not discussed here but perform swizzling and deliver
 *    all legacy INTx messages to the virtual-wire crossbar as shown.  MSI/MSI-X
 *    messages are put onto the virtual APIC bus directly unless the IOMMU is in
 *    use.
 *
 * 3. From each IOAPIC or MSI/MSI-X end device, the IOMMU can perform remapping
 *    of the messages placed onto the ("northbridge") APIC bus.
 *
 * In reality, the CPU address/data buses and the northbridge buses are
 * effectively the same bus; they are not buses at all but routed networks
 * switched by crossbars in the data fabric, so that they share an address space
 * (for MMIO, RAM, and the APICs) but just as in more familiar networks traffic
 * can be intercepted and modified at each hop.
 *
 * The messages placed onto the conceptual "APIC bus" contain a source ID and a
 * destination vector; the address of these messages selects the destination
 * APIC(s).  Internal hardware-specific implementation provides additional
 * source identification such as is used by the IOMMU.
 *
 * The mechanism for PCI MSI/X is relatively straightforward and works the way
 * the standard would lead one to expect.  For fixed interrupts, however, we
 * have nearly unlimited flexibility: each interrupt source has a unique fixed
 * hardware ID that indexes into the FCH's virtual wire crossbar table and is
 * used to select the virtual pin input on the IOAPIC.  The IOAPIC in turn has a
 * redirection table entry for each such virtual pin input that defines 8 bits
 * of the destination APIC ID to be placed in the corresponding APIC message
 * destination address field and an 8-bit vector constituting part of the APIC
 * data payload.  At this point our fixed interrupt has been transformed into an
 * APIC bus message very similar to an interrupt that originated downstream as a
 * PCIe MSI or MSI-X interrupt!  From here, any type of interrupt message may be
 * intercepted and remapped by the IOMMU, allowing us to deliver messages to
 * more than 255 CPUs in physical addressing mode (clustered addressing mode,
 * not used by illumos, is not discussed here) as well as to support advanced
 * features like access control and diversion of interrupts into a guest virtual
 * machine.
 *
 * ======================
 * Interrupts and the DDI
 * ======================
 *
 * Let's talk assumptions about devinfo node properties.  This should really be
 * on its way to a committed interface described in the manual, but given how
 * awful it's been historically and in many ways still is (especially on i86pc),
 * perhaps it's for the best that it isn't.  A handful of properties are
 * documented in sysbus(4) and pci(4); at present, both of these man pages are
 * largely obsolete, referring to technologies such as Solaris and PCI-X in the
 * present tense, though some of their limited descriptions of OBP-style
 * properties remains correct.  The manual also assumes that all x86 systems
 * running illumos use the i86pc kernel, platform drivers, and conventions; this
 * has in general been true historically but our existence renders this
 * assumption inaccurate.  Additionally, there is no sysbus driver and the man
 * page describing it refers to ISA as an "x86 ... system bus" which it
 * certainly is not on any machine supported by now 64-bit-only illumos.
 *
 * In the long run, we might want to replace all of these node properties with
 * private data, perhaps faking up equivalent output for prtconf(8) and similar
 * tools.  Or we might want to use OBP-style properties exclusively and provide
 * more convenience functions for leaf drivers, nexus drivers, and DDI/NDI code
 * to interpret them.  In reality, the way this works today is that some code
 * looks up data in OBP properties while other code uses private data storage,
 * and quite a lot of code especially in nexus drivers and apix actually uses
 * both: much of what's going on here consists of reading OBP properties and
 * translating them into various private data structures that are then passed
 * around.  The code that ultimately consumes that may or may not understand the
 * OBP properties, may or may not get a dev_info_t along with the private data
 * or handle, and may or may not follow the same conventions as the original
 * device driver.  In many cases, there is no good way to know what the data
 * type of a child or parent private data structure even is unless you are the
 * driver that attached it, yet there are many places here in the DDI/NDI and in
 * the rootnex driver that make all kinds of assumptions about both the OBP
 * properties and associated private data.  To the best of my knowledge, this is
 * the first halfway serious attempt to describe what those assumptions are.
 *
 * Interrupt-related Node Properties
 *
 * Coming back to the properties that are associated with device nodes,
 * historically there have been at least two different formats used to describe
 * interrupt usage in OBP-style properties on i86pc.  The older style named a
 * property "intr" and defined it to contain pairs of integers specifying the
 * ipl and irq number of each interrupt.  Recall from our discussion above that
 * these have little to do with one another: the ipl is a matter of delivery
 * policy (which might be specified by a driver.conf file) while the irq number
 * is primarily an ACPI concept describing either how very old hardware is
 * physically configured or how firmware has configured the virtual wire
 * crossbar switch(es).  The second property style provides a node called
 * "interrupts" which is simply a list of irq numbers.  In either case, the inum
 * or interrupt number used in handles, PSM code, and intr_ops routines indexes
 * into these arrays.  In the newer style, a separate property
 * "interrupt-priorities" provides an array of driver.conf-supplied ipls in
 * which each entry describes the desired delivery ipl for each interrupt
 * source.  If the driver.conf does not supply these, as is typical, a
 * collection of heuristic defaults is used instead, ultimately defaulting to
 * ipl 5.  The PCI subsystem has its own way to derive default ipls based on
 * device class.
 *
 * In addition to the OBP properties, we have several C data types used
 * (sometimes) to store information about a device's interrupt source,
 * intermediate hardware routing, destination, and delivery policy.  These
 * include:
 *
 * struct intrspec
 *
 *   Nominally used "only by old DDI interrupt interfaces", this in fact
 *   pollutes the code in a number of places.  Its members are an ipl, an irq
 *   number incorrectly called a vector, and a handler function pointer.  This
 *   was originally intended to correspond to be a C representation of the
 *   old-style "intr" OBP-style property, much as struct regspec corresponds to
 *   the "reg" property.  The handler function pointer is never invoked, but
 *   there is still a lot of code in other drivers that updates it.
 *
 * struct prop_ispec
 *
 *   This helper type is used to convert the old-style OBP "intr" property into
 *   C data types; it's not used outside the nominally machdep DDI
 *   implementation.
 *
 * ddi_intr_handle_impl_t [as opaque ddi_intr_handle_t]
 *
 *   Again we have a "vector" member that describes in irq number, not a vector.
 *   We also have ih_private, which is *sometimes* (but by no means always!) an
 *   idhl_plat_t on i86pc and maybe on oxide too.  The actual type appears to be
 *   an undocumented part of the PSM interface; like the types of arguments to
 *   bus_intr_op, they vary with the operation being performed.
 *
 * ihdl_plat_t (machdep)
 *
 *   This structure contains the above intrspec as well as kstats and a
 *   performance counter.  Note that this field is often used to hold other data
 *   types specific to various PSM operations.  While it is supposedly specific
 *   to the machine architecture, there are several drivers in uts/common that
 *   make all kinds of assumptions about it.
 *
 * struct ddi_parent_private_data
 *
 *   While parent-private data structures are set as void *, rootnex and the
 *   machdep DDI implementation (here) often want and expect it to be of this
 *   type.  The interrupt-relevant members are par_nintr, a count of interrupt
 *   sources associated with this (child) node, and yet another "obsolete"
 *   instance of struct intrspec, this time an array of them, one representing
 *   each source.
 *
 * FCH Implementation
 *
 * In order to accommodate the existing "common" code, we've avoided changing
 * this, and this nexus driver instead contains interrupt management code that
 * tries to accommodate both the way the hardware actually works on one side
 * (i.e., without an ACPI BIOS) and the PC-centric way that existing illumos
 * code wants to treat these pieces of data.  The result is rather unsatisfying
 * and several additional comments put finer points on this, notably in ixbar.c.
 * We can get away with this by not supporting fixed interrupts for any devices
 * that are not our children, notably PCIe, but we have lost a number of bits of
 * data along the way and end up with rather grotty interfaces.
 *
 * The secondary FCH is a complete mystery when it comes to interrupts.  Huashan
 * doesn't allow any secondary FCH peripherals to be used that can ever generate
 * interrupts, which makes sense as it's not at all clear where they go or how
 * they get there.  This isn't necessarily the case on processors containing
 * Songshan, but we don't know whether these peripherals (I2C and I3C in
 * particular) can actually generate interrupts or would have to be used in
 * polled mode on secondary sockets.  We do know that GPIO pins, even AGPIOs,
 * cannot generate interrupts from the second socket, so it's likely that this
 * simply doesn't work and we will end up never exposing any of these children
 * on secondary FCHs.  If it does work, it seems likely that these sources go to
 * the secondary FCH's virtual wire crossbar which in turn directs them into
 * that FCH's IOAPIC.  From there, routing over the DF onto the imaginary APIC
 * bus would be fairly straightforward (this is already how MSI/X interrupts
 * from PCIe devices work).  For now we don't support the secondary FCH's
 * virtual wire crossbar at all, and none of the children that can generate
 * interrupts are enumerated on secondary FCHs.

 *
 * 1. Use the Private ddi_map() instead of ddi_regs_map_setup().
 * 2. Add an oxide-Private 1275 property of which rootnex and its children are
 *    aware that indicates the "reg" property of a child contains 64-bit values,
 *    in which case rootnex can always interpret DDI_MT_RNUMBER requests
 *    properly and we can use ddi_regs_map_setup().
 * 3. Force enumeration of rootnex's children through rootnex itself,
 *    eliminating the ability of a child to create its own device node attached
 *    to rootnex.  This would restore rootnex's privacy and allow it to always
 *    use 64-bit properties for its direct children.  This seems ideal, but it
 *    would also leave us with the problem of what to do about nexi that pass
 *    DDI_MT_RNUMBER requests up to rootnex for their children.  While the ideal
 *    answer is that child nexi wanting to do that must conform to rootnex's
 *    (Private) property formats, that seems a bit unreasonable both in
 *    principle and in terms of supporting existing nexi.
 * 4. Cope with the fact that DDI_MT_RNUMBER means 32-bits.
 *
 * For sake of immediate simplicity I've opted for (4), but (1) would be quite
