/*
 * When the AMD Milan SoC is initialized, this is done by passing a bunch of
 * configuration to the PSP through the SPI flash which is called the APCB.
 * After the PSP processes all this, it is transformed and output for us through
 * something called the APOB -- AMD PSP Output Block. This file attempts to
 * iterate, parse, and provide a means of getting at it.
 *
 * Our intention is that access to the APOB through this mechanism is provided
 * as an soc-bootops style service. Anything that is cared about should be added
 * as a property in the devinfo tree.
 *
 * This relies entirely on boot services for things and as such we have to be a
 * bit careful about the operations that we use to ensure that we can get torn
 * down with boot services.
 *
 * The APOB is structured as an initial header (milan_apob_header_t) which is
 * always immediately followed by the first entry (hence why it is in the
 * structure). Each entry itself contains its size and has an absolute offset to
 * the next entry.
