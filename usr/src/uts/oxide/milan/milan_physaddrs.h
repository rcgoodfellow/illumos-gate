 * The following diagram describes how physical memory is allocated on this
 * system. There are a couple of things to note. First, there are two major
 * reserved areas that exist in the > 4GiB space, each of which is 12 GiB in
 * size. The lower one is problematic in that it shows up right in the middle of
 * the above 4 GiB region of DRAM. As such, we will make sure that we never
 * start MMIO space below this point as we have plenty of space and there's not
 * really much point.
