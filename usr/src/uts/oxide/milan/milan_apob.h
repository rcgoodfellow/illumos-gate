 *
 * A note on constants, especially in array sizes: These often correspond
 * to constants that have real meaning and that we have defined elsewhere, such
 * as the maximum number of CCXs per CCD.  However, we do not and MUST NOT use
 * those constants here, because the sizes in the APOB may not be the same as
 * the underlying physical meaning.  In this example, the APOB seems to have
 * been defined so that it could support both Rome and Milan, allowing up to
 * 2 CCXs for each of 8 CCDs (per socket).  There is no real part that has
 * been made that way, as far as we know, which means the APOB structures must
 * be considered their own completely independent thing.
 *
 * Never confuse the APOB with reality.
