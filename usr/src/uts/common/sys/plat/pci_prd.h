/*
 * PCI Platform Resource Discovery (PRD)
 *
 * This file forms the platform-specific interfaces that a given platform must
 * implement to support the discovery of PCI resources. In particular:
 *
 *  o Any root complexes that do not show up through the use of normal scanning
 *  o Available resources per root-port including:
 *	+ I/O ports
 *	+ Prefetchable Memory
 *	+ Normal Memory
 *	+ PCI buses
 *  o The naming of slots (the platform uses the PCIe default)
 *
 * These interfaces are all expected to be implemented by a platform's 'pci_prd'
 * module. This is left as a module and not a part of say, unix, so that it can
 * in turn depend on other modules that a platform might require, such as ACPI.
 *
 * In general, unless otherwise indicated, these interfaces will always be
 * called from kernel context, typically during boot. The interfaces will only
 * be called from a single thread at this time and any locking is managed at a
 * layer outside of the pci_prd interfaces. If the subsystem is using some other
 * interfaces that may be used by multiple consumers and needs locking (e.g.
 * ACPI), then that still must be considered in the design and implementation.
