/*
 * Interrupt operation types passed to the bus_intr_op() NDI endpoint.  Comments
 * above each operation describe the purpose and the interpretation of the
 * result parameter passed by pointer into the endpoint.  These descriptions
 * refer to parameters according to this conventional prototype:
 *
 * int bus_intr_ops(dev_info_t *dip, dev_info_t *rdip, ddi_intr_op_t op,
 *     ddi_intr_handle_impl_t *hdl, void *result);
 *
 * For all operations, dip references the node corresponding to the nexus
 * instance whose endpoint is being called.  rdip references the requesting or
 * responsible node, the node to which the operation applies.  In general it is
 * possible for dip == rdip.  Often, rdip is a child node of dip, but as
 * requests may be passed up the tree, it is possible for rdip to be an indirect
 * descendent of dip, so implementers cannot always assume that the properties
 * or private data attached to rdip conform to the conventions the receiving
 * nexus implements with respect to its immediate children.
 *
 * Similarly, hdl may point to a handle that was previously initialised by the
 * receiving nexus's ALLOC op following a call by the child driver to
 * ddi_intr_alloc(), but for some operations this is not the case.  These
 * exceptions are noted in the description of each operation to which they
 * apply; additionally, when operations are passed up the tree, the state of the
 * handler may not always match the way the receiving nexus would have
 * initialised it even if it was previously initialised by a child nexus's ALLOC
 * endpoint.  These inconsistencies are generally bugs in child nexus drivers
 * encouraged by general weaknesses in the NDI, but we highlight them here as
 * they are often behind various special cases in nexus drivers.
