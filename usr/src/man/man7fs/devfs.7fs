.Sh NAME
.Nm devfs
.Nd Devices file system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
filesystem manages a name space of all devices in the operating environment and
is mounted during boot on the
.Pa /devices
name space.
.Pp
The
.Pa /devices
name space is dynamic and reflects the current state of accessible devices.
The names of all attached device instances are present under
.Pa /devices .
.Pp
The content under
.Pa /devices
is under the exclusive control of the
.Nm
filesystem and cannot be changed.
.Pp
The system may be configured to include a device in one of two ways:
.Bl -enum
.It
By means of dynamic reconfiguration
.Pq DR ,
using, for example,
.Xr cfgadm 1M .
Several different hardware buses such as PCIe and USB automatically discover and
enumerate devices that they encounter.
.It
For devices driven by
.Xr driver.conf 4
enumeration, edit the
.Pa driver.conf
file to add a new entry, then use
.Xr update_drv 1M
to cause the system to re-read the
.Pa driver.conf
file and thereby enumerate the instance.
.El
.Pp
The device may be attached through a number of system calls and programs,
including
.Xr open 2 ,
.Xr stat 2 ,
and
.Xr ls 1 .
During device attach, the device driver typically creates minor nodes
corresponding to the device via
.Xr ddi_create_minor_node 9F .
If the attach is successful, one or more minor nodes referring to the device are
created under
.Pa /devices .
.Pp
Operations like
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr mkdir 2 ,
and
.Xr creat 2
are not supported in
.Pa /devices .
.Pp
This file system is not present in a non-global zone.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa
.It Pa /devices
Mount point for
.Nm
file system in the global zone.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr devfsadm 1M ,
.Xr vfstab 4 ,
.Xr attach 9E
.Sh NOTES
The
.Pa /devices
name space cannot be unmounted.
.Pp
All content at or below the
.Pa /devices
name space is an implementation
artifact and subject to incompatible change or removal without notification.
Generally, user programs should leverage the device name space under
.Pa /dev .
