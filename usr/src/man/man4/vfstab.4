.Sh NAME
.Nm vfstab
.Nd table of file system defaults
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/vfstab
describes defaults for each file system.
The information is stored in a table with the following column headings:
.Bd -literal
device       device       mount      FS      fsck    mount      mount
to mount     to fsck      point      type    pass    at boot    options
.Ed
.Pp
The fields in the table are space-separated and show the resource name
.Pq Fa device to mount ,
the raw device to
.Sy fsck
.Pq Em device to fsck ,
the default mount directory
.Pq Em mount point ,
the name of the file system type
.Pq Em FS type ,
the number used by
.Xr fsck 1M
to decide whether to check the file system automatically
.Pq Em fsck pass ,
whether the file system should be mounted automatically by
.Xr mountall 1M
.Pq Em mount at boot ,
and the file system mount options
.Pq Em mount options .
See respective mount file system man page below in
.Sx SEE ALSO
for
.Em mount options.
A
.Sq -
is used to indicate no entry in a field.
This may be used when a field does not apply to the resource being mounted.
.Pp
The
.Xr getvfsent 3C
family of routines is used to read
.Pa /etc/vfstab .
There are currently no library routines to automate the writing of
.Pa /etc/vfstab .
.Pp
.Pa /etc/vfstab
can be used to specify swap areas.
An entry so specified,
.Pq which can be a file or a device ,
will automatically be added as a swap area by the
.Pa /sbin/swapadd
script when the system boots.
To specify a swap area, the
.Em device-to-mount
field contains the name of the swap file or device, the
.Em FS-type
is
.Dq swap ,
.Em mount-at-boot
is
.Dq no
and all other fields have no entry.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following are
.Pa /etc/vfstab
entries for various file system types supported in illumos.
.Pp
.Sy Example 1
NFS and UFS Mounts
.Pp
The following entry invokes NFS to automatically mount the directory
.Pa /usr/local
of the server
.Sy example1
on the client's
.Pa /usr/local
directory with read-only permission:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
example1:/usr/local - /usr/local nfs - yes ro
.Ed
.Pp
The following example assumes a small departmental mail setup, in which clients
mount
.Pa /var/mail
from a server
.Sy mailsvr .
The following entry would be listed in each client's
.Pa /etc/vfstab:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mailsvr:/var/mail - /var/mail nfs - yes intr,bg
.Ed
.Pp
The following is an example for a UFS file system in which logging is enabled:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/dev/dsk/c2t10d0s0 /dev/rdsk/c2t10d0s0 /export/local ufs 3 yes logging
.Ed
.Pp
See
.Xr mount_nfs 1M
for a description of NFS mount options and
.Xr mount_ufs 1M
for a description of UFS options.
.Pp
.Sy Example 2
pcfs Mounts
.Pp
The following example mounts a pcfs file system on a fixed hard disk on an x86
machine:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/dev/dsk/c1t2d0p0:c - /win98 pcfs - yes -
.Ed
.Pp
The example below mounts a Jaz drive on a SPARC machine.
Normally, the volume management software handles mounting of removable media,
obviating a
.Nm
entry.
Specifying a device that supports removable media in
.Pa /etc/vfstab
with set the mount-at-boot field to
.Dq no
.Pq as shown below
disables the automatic handling of that device.
Such an entry presumes you are not running volume management software.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/dev/dsk/c1t2d0s2:c - /jaz pcfs - no -
.Ed
.Pp
For removable media on a SPARC machine, the convention for the slice portion of
the disk identifier is to specify
.Sy s2 ,
which stands for the entire medium.
.Pp
For pcfs file systems on x86 machines, note that the disk identifier uses
a
.Sy p
.Pq Sy p0
and a logical drive
.Po
.Sy c ,
in the
.Pa /win98
example above
.Pc
for a pcfs logical drive.
See
.Xr mount_pcfs 1M
for syntax for pcfs logical drives and for pcfs-specific mount options.
.Pp
.Sy Example 3
loopback File System Mount
.Pp
The following is an example of mounting a loopback
.Pq lofs
file system:
.Bd -literal
/export/test - /opt/test lofs - yes -
.Ed
See
.Xr lofs 7FS
for an overview of the loopback file system.
