.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn kstat_read
function gets data from the kernel for the kstat pointed to by
.Fa ksp .
The
.Ql ksp->ks_data
field is automatically allocated
.Pq or reallocated
to be large enough to hold all of the data.
The
.Ql ksp->ks_ndata
field is set to the number of data fields,
.Ql ksp->ks_data_size
is set to the total size of the data, and
.Ql ksp->ks_snaptime
is set to the high-resolution time at which the data snapshot was taken.
If
.Fa buf
is non-null, the data is copied from
.Ql ksp->ks_data
to
.Fa buf .
.Pp
The
.Fn kstat_write
function writes data from
.Fa buf ,
or from
.Ql ksp->ks_data
if
.Fa buf
is
.Dv NULL
to the corresponding kstat in the kernel.
Only a privileged user can use
.Fn kstat_write .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn kstat_read
and
.Fn kstat_write
return the current kstat chain ID (KCID).
Otherwise, they return
.Sy -1
and set
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
