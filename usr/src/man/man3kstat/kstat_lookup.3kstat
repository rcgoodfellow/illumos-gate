.Lb libkstat
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In kstat.h
.Ft "kstat_t *"
.Fo kstat_lookup
.Fa "kstat_ctl_t *kc"
.Fa "const char *ks_module"
.Fa "int ks_instance"
.Fa "const char *ks_name"

.Ft "void *"
.Fo kstat_data_lookup
.Fa "kstat_t *ksp"
.Fa "const char *name"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn kstat_lookup
function traverses the kstat chain,
.Ql kc->kc_chain ,
searching for a kstat with the same
.Fa ks_module ,
.Fa ks_instance ,
and
.Fa ks_name
fields; this triplet uniquely identifies a kstat.
If
.Fa ks_module ,
is
.Dv NULL ,
.Fa ks_instance
is -1, or
.Fa ks_name
is
.Dv NULL ,
those fields will be ignored in the search.
For
example,
.Fo kstat_lookup
.Fa kc ,
.Fa NULL ,
.Fa -1 ,
.Fa "foo"
.Fc
will find the first kstat with name
.Dq foo .
.Pp
The
.Fn kstat_data_lookup
function searches the kstat's data section for the record with the specified
.Fa name .
This operation is valid only for those kstat types that have named data records:
.Dv KSTAT_TYPE_NAMED
and
.Dv KSTAT_TYPE_TIMER .
.Ss Lifetime
The
.Vt kstat_t
structures and any associated data are owned by the library and the
corresponding handle,
.Fa kc .
That is, two callers with same library handle will generally have the same
memory returned to them, though this is not a guaranteed part of the interface.
Callers should not modify or attempt to free the data associated with either.
Calling the
.Xr kstat_chain_update 3KSTAT
or
.Xr kstat_close 3KSTAT
functions on the handle
.Fa kc
will cause the
pointers returned from these functions with the same handle to be invalid.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn kstat_lookup
function returns a pointer to the requested kstat if it is found.
Otherwise it returns
.Dv NULL
and sets
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.Pp
The
.Fn kstat_data_lookup
function returns a pointer to the requested data record if it is found.
Otherwise it returns
.Dv NULL
and sets
.Va errno
to indicate the error.

.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn kstat_lookup
and
.Fn kstat_data_lookup
functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er EINVAL
An attempt was made to look up data for a kstat that was not of type
.Dv KSTAT_TYPE_NAMED
or
.Dv KSTAT_TYPE_TIMER .
.It Er ENOENT
The requested kstat could not be found.
