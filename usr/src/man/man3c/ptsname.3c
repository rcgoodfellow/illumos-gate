.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft char *
.Fo ptsname
.Fa "int fildes"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ptsname
function returns the name of the pseudo-terminal subsidiary device associated
with a pseudo-terminal manager device.
The
.Fa fildes
argument is a file descriptor returned from a successful open of the
pseudo-terminal manager device; e.g., by calling
.Xr posix_openpt 3C
or by performing an
.Xr open 2
of the
.Xr ptm 7D
device.
.Pp
The
.Fn ptsname
function returns a pointer to a string containing the null-terminated
path name of the subsidiary device.
This string is of the form
.Pa /dev/pts/N ,
where
.Sy N
is a non-negative integer.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn ptsname
function returns a pointer to a string which is the name of the pseudo-terminal
subsidiary device.
This value points to a static data area that is overwritten by each call to
.Fn ptsname .
.Pp
Upon failure,
.Fn ptsname
returns
.Dv NULL .
This could occur if
.Fa fildes
is an invalid file descriptor or if the subsidiary device name does not exist
in the file system.
