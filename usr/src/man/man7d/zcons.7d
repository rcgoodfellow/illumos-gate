.Sh NAME
.Nm zcons
.Nd Zone console device driver
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm zcons
character driver exports the console for system zones.
The driver is fundamentally similar to a pseudo-terminal device, and is thus
comprised of two sides:
.Bl -bullet
.It
a manager device, which applications in the global zone can open for
communication
.It
a subsidiary device, which processes in the non-global zone can write to, to
communicate with global zone management applications
.El
.Pp
Applications must not depend on the location of
.Pa /dev
or
.Pa /devices
entries exposed by
.Nm zcons
in the global zone.
Inside a non-global zone, the
.Nm zcons
subsidiary device is fronted by
.Pa /dev/console
and other console-related symbolic links, which are used by applications that
expect to write to the system console.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver is not a
.Sy Committed
interface, and may change at any time.
