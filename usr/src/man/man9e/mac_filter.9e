.Sh INTERFACE LEVEL
.Sy Uncommitted -
This interface is still evolving.
API and ABI stability is not guaranteed.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width Fa
.It Fa driver
A pointer to the ring's private data that was passed in via the
.Vt mgi_driver
member of the
.Xr mac_group_info 9S
structure as part of the
.Xr mr_gget 9E
entry point.
.It Fa mac
A pointer to an array of bytes that contains the unicast address to add
or remove from a filter.
It is guaranteed to be at least as long, in bytes, as the MAC plugin's
address length.
For Ethernet devices that length is six bytes,
.Dv ETHERADDRL .
.It Fa vlan
The numeric value of the VLAN that should be added or removed from a
filter.
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mac_filter
family of entry points are used to add and remove various classes of
filters from a device.
For more information on the filters, see the
.Sy Filters
section of
.Xr mac_capab_rings 9S
and the discussion around setting these members in
.Xr mac_group_info 9S .
.Pp
The
.Fa driver
argument indicates which group the request to add or remove a filter is
being requested on.
.Pp
The filter addition operations,
.Fn mgi_addmac ,
.Fn mgi_addvlan ,
and
.Fn mgi_addmvf ,
all instruct the system to add a filter to the specified group.
The filter should not target any specific ring in the group.
If multiple rings are present, then the driver should ensure that the
hardware balances incoming traffic amongst all of the rings through a
consistent hashing mechanism such as receive side scaling.
.Pp
The
.Fn mgi_addmac
entry point instructs the driver to add the MAC address specified in
.Fa mac
to the filter list for the group.
The MAC address should always be a unicast MAC address; however, the
driver is encouraged to verify that before adding it.
.Pp
The
.Fn mgi_remmac
should remove the MAC address specified in
.Fa mac
from the filter list for the group.
.Pp
The
.Fn mgi_addvlan
entry point instructs the driver to add the VLAN specified in
.Fa vlan
to the filter list for the group.
The
.Fn mgi_remvlan
entry point instructs the driver to remove the VLAN specified in
.Fa vlan
from the filter list for the group.
.Ss Stacking Filters
Multiple filters of the same class should always be treated as a
logical-OR.
The frame may match any of the filters in a given class to be accepted.
Filters of different classes should always be treated as a logical-AND.
The frame must match a filter in all programmed classes to be accepted.
For more information, see the
.Sy Filters
section of
.Xr mac_capab_rings 9S .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the driver should ensure that the filter has
been added or removed and return
.Sy 0 .
Otherwise, it should return the appropriate error number.
.Sh ERRORS
The device driver may return one of the following errors.
While this list is not intended to be exhaustive, it is recommended to use one
of these if possible.
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er EEXIST
The requested filter has already been programmed into the device.
.It Er EINVAL
The address
.Fa mac
is not a valid unicast address.
The VLAN
.Fa vlan
is not a valid VLAN identifier.
.It Er EIO
The driver encountered a device or transport error while trying to
update the device's state.
.It Er ENOENT
The driver was asked to remove a filter which was not currently
programmed.
.It Er ENOTSUP
The driver does not support this specific function.
This should only be used on specific hardware
.Pq generally devices from cloud providers
where neither promiscuous mode nor filters will allow
the filter to operate.
.It Er ENOSPC
The driver has run out of available hardware filters.
